# WordPair Replacer Tool

## Overview

Welcome to the **WordPair Replacer Tool**! This web application is designed to help you efficiently replace words or phrases in your text using either predefined sets or a quick replace functionality. Whether you're editing a document, performing bulk replacements, or just experimenting with text transformations, this tool is built to make the process fast, intuitive, and flexible.

To use it just "run" the index.html - all is self contained within.

### Use Case: Streamlining Transcript Formatting
Imagine you're working with a series of transcripts where names are formatted as "Lastname, Firstname (business unit)" but you need them to appear as "[[Firstname Lastname]]" for your own notes or to create links in a Markdown document. With the WordPair Replacer Tool, you can create a set of replacement pairs that automatically convert these name formats. By simply pasting your transcript into the tool, all specified fragments are instantly replaced according to your predefined rules, allowing you to process multiple names or other text fragments in one seamless step. This not only saves time but ensures consistency across your documents.

### Key Features
- **Create Sets**: Easily create and manage sets of text pairs for bulk replacements. Each pair can consist of single or multiple words, making it ideal for various text modification tasks.
- **Quick Replace**: For those moments when you need to replace a word or phrase on the fly, the quick replace feature allows you to do so without the need to create a set.
- **Undo Functionality**: Made a mistake? No problem! The undo function lets you revert your last replacement action.
- **Import/Export**: Save your replacement sets for future use or load existing ones, making it easy to switch between different projects.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark modes to suit your viewing preferences, with your choice saved for future sessions.

## How to Use
1. **Enter Text**: Start by typing or pasting your text into the main text area.
2. **Create a Set**: If you have multiple replacements to make, create a set of word or phrase pairs. The set editor allows you to add, remove, or reorder these pairs.
3. **Quick Replace**: For single, quick changes, use the quick replace feature located above the text area.
4. **Replace Text**: Click the "Replace (with set)" button to apply your predefined set of replacements to the text.
5. **Undo if Needed**: If the replacement didn't go as planned, use the "Undo" button to revert your last action.
6. **Copy Modified Text**: Once satisfied, copy your modified text to the clipboard with a single click.
7. **Dark Mode**: For a different visual experience, toggle the dark mode using the switch in the upper right corner.

Experiment with different replacement sets and quick replace options to quickly transform your text and streamline your workflow.

## Development Background

### AI-Generated Source Code
The entire codebase for the WordPair Replacer Tool was generated by a generative AI (model: Claude 3 Haiku / 2024-08-28), resulting in a fully functional application built without manual coding. Below is the sequence of prompts used to create this tool:

1. **Initial Setup**: "A web app that allows the user to create and store sets that contain word pairs. The app also contains a text box and a button. When the button is clicked, the currently selected set will be used to search-and-replace the text in the text box with the word pairs - each word will be searched and replaced by its partner word from the set."
2. **Storage Implementation**: "Save set will store the set in the HTML5 local storage of the browser."
3. **UI Enhancements**: "Make the UI nicer - the word pairs are on the left side of the screen while the text box is as large as possible."
4. **Set Editing UI**: "When the set is selected, show the set edit user interface allowing to add/remove pairs."
5. **Multi-Word Support**: "Change the sets to be able to contain multi-word texts which get replaced with other multi-word texts instead of just single words."
6. **UI Refinement**: "Make the set editing UI a bit slicker, smaller, and display the currently selected set name."
7. **Clipboard Functionality**: "Add a button next to the replace text button which copies the content of the text box to the clipboard."
8. **Data Import/Export**: "Add a function that allows all stored information to be downloaded and uploaded/restored as a single file."
9. **Set Sorting**: "Add the option to sort/change the order of the pairs in the set."
10. **Quick Replace Feature**: "Add an additional quick-pair option and replace button above the text box which allows to do a quick search and replace."
11. **Undo Functionality**: "Add an undo button."
12. **Help Menu**: "Add a help menu icon to the upper right next to the quick replace section which opens a modal dialog explaining what this app does and how to use it."
13. **Dark Mode**: "Add a dark mode toggle below the question mark and save the toggle state to local storage."

This iterative process showcases how AI can be leveraged to create functional and user-friendly applications with minimal manual intervention.
